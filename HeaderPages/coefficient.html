        <h1>What is an Effective Coefficient?</h1>

        <p>An Effective Coefficient is a simplified way of understanding statistics of a singular Pokémon, without knowing 
            anything about a second Pokémon.  All Stats in Pokémon are related to another Pokémon.  A 100 damage move does 
            more damage to a Pokémon with 10 defense than one with 100, for example.  In order to get a general baseline on 
            Pokémon effectiveness, I've created two important terms.
        </p>

        <h3>Effective Health Coefficient</h3>

        <p>Normally, the health of a Pokémon is determined simply by a numeric value (like 100).  However, a Pokémon with 
            100 health and 10 defense is not as bulky as a Pokémon with 100 health and 30 defense, obviously.  So, this can 
            be simplified simply by multiplying the two together, to understand a total picture on health, and effective health 
            and actual health.
        </p>

        <h4>But what's the difference between Actual Health and Effective Health?</h4>

        <p>Normally, this wouldn't be an important distinction.  However, in Max Battles, Pokémon have the ability Max Spirit, 
            which health EVERYONE in the Max Battle based on a percent of the user's HP.  For this, effective health doesn't matter, 
            and only actual health matters.
