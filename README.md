Mission Statement:

Hello!  My handle is WaywardOath, and I am an avid Pokemon GO fan!  Having spent a large amount of time in a local community where I was constantly confused about mechanics in Pokemon GO (and so were fellow locals), I decided to make a tool to showcase some of the more
confusing mechanics of the game!  Chiefly, I wanted to show a direct representation of how much the stats of a Pokemon increases per level, and how effective Dynamax moves are at each level (both Pokemon level and move level).  

This is a passion project, and I do not mind hearing from you for suggestions on how to improve it!  I can be reached on GitHub, or on any social media under the name WaywardOath.
